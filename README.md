**WebRTC POC Implementation**

A comprehensive Proof of Concept demonstrating real-time peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC technology. This project showcases the implementation of WebRTC's core features including signaling, ICE candidate exchange, and direct peer connections.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time peer-to-peer communication
- Signaling server implementation
- ICE candidate handling
- STUN/TURN server integration
- NAT traversal techniques
- Modern React frontend with TypeScript

**Technical Stack:**

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
- Backend: Node.js, Socket.io
- WebRTC APIs: RTCPeerConnection, RTCSessionDescription, RTCIceCandidate

This project serves as a demonstration for public talks and speaking engagements, illustrating WebRTC concepts and implementation patterns for real-time communication applications.
